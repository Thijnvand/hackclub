I have made a hackpad using fusion and KiCad. I Have made a simple construction with 4 keys 7 LED's and an OLED-screen. I Put the LED next to the switches so they can teel which switch had been pressed, and I put three LED's at the bottom. Also above the siwtches is an OLED-screen which can dispkay various things. The bottom part of the case is just a simple holder for the PCB with holes in them fo heatset inserts. I had never used KiCad before in my life so with a few youtube video's and various hours of trial and error I made my PCB. I had experience with CAD-software, but not with fusion, but that part did relatively go well.

Overall I like my creation and gained some skills form using KiCad and Fusion!
This is my hackpad:
